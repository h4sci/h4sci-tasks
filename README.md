# h4sci-tasks

Tasks and Exercises for Participants of the 2020 course taught within the D-MTEC of PhD program of ETH Zurich. This repository will stay private. Students answers will **not** be publicly exposed. Publication of any contrbutions to this repository is not permitted without explicit prior consent of the person(s) who contributed. 


## Structure

- The [issue tracker](https://github.com/h4sci/h4sci-tasks/issues) lists all tasks and helps to monitor our proceedings. 
- `submissions` folder contains student submission. File should be named according to following convention `task-XX-student-name.md` for individual submissions and `task-XX-group-name.md` . 


## Groups

Assignment into groups is random. We can try to adjust groups later on if it makes sense to everyone involved. This could be the case when a particular group of students may want to work on a real world problem in their semester project, e.g., thesis related. Please report back early on if you have such a semester project in mind. 

Groups are named according to a stack of Poker cards:

1. Aces
2. Kings
3. Queens
4. Jacks
5. Tens
6. Nines 
7. Eights
8. Sevens (if needed).

We will aim at a group size of 3-5 persons per group. In addition every participant will be assigned one of clubs (♣), diamonds (♦), hearts (♥) or spades (♠). This will help create meta groups for cross group discussions etc. easily.
